1) Excell Limitations:

- **Data Redundancy**: Excel lacks mechanisms to prevent duplicate entries, leading to redundancy and inconsistent data.
- **Manual Errors**: Data entry in Excel is often manual, increasing the risk of human errors that can compromise data accuracy.
- **Difficulty in Managing Relationships**: Excel does not support complex relational data structures, making it challenging to maintain relationships between tables.
- Scalability issues : Excell can't handle more than 1 million rows


2) Why Move to a DBMS?

- **Improved Data Integrity**: DBMSs enforce rules to reduce redundancy and minimize errors.
- **Better Data Relationships**: A DBMS can define and maintain relationships between tables, enhancing data accuracy.
- **Scalability**: DBMSs handle large datasets effectively, supporting companies as their data needs grow.
